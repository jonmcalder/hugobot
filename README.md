# Hugo

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonmcalder/hugobot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonmcalder/hugobot)

Hugo is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. He was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku].

If you're looking to setup your own instance of hubot then explore the links below and/or have a look at my [blog post on Hugo](https://jonmcalder.github.io/2016-12-12-introducing-hugo/) which provides an overview of the setup process.
